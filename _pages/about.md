I do research with the [Social Development Research Group](https://depts.washington.edu/sdrg/) in the School of Social Work, University of Washington. My research interests include occupational and substance use epidemiology and the effects that policies, programs, and where we live have on our health. 

Emigrated from Hue, Vietnam, I was raised in Akron, Ohio (and hence, became [just another kid from Akron](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2016/06/lebron_james_im_just_a_kid_fro.html)). I received my PhD in Epidemiology at University of Washington, where my dissertation (advised by [Isaac Rhew](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/rhew-isaac/)) examined the relationship between cannabis use and access on prescription opioid use and other related outcomes among injured workers in Washington. During my PhD training, I was a research assistant with the [Occupational Epidemiology and Health Outcomes Program](https://deohs.washington.edu/occepi/occupational-epidemiology-and-health-outcomes-program), under the direction of [Gary Franklin](https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/gary-m-franklin) and [Deborah Fulton-Kehoe](http://depts.washington.edu/hservphd/articles/1732). We collaborated with [WA State Labor & Industries](https://www.lni.wa.gov/) in order to evaluate policies, best practices, and health delivery models aimed at reducing work-related injuries and disability. 

I am a 2x alumni of The Ohio State University, where minoring in [dubious](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1882751-the-craziest-tradition-in-college-football-is-osus-mirror-lake-jump) [traditions](https://bleacherreport.com/crossing-out-ms-traditionagainist) against the team from the north was common. Due to the wide utility of epidemiolgy, I've worked on some fun, diverse projects, such as a health impact assessment of a multimodal transportation plan at [Columbus Public Health](https://www.columbus.gov/publichealth/programs/Healthy-Places/) and examining the comparative effectiveness of pediatric medications with [Jonathan Slaughter](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/find-a-doctor/profiles/jonathan-l-slaughter) at Nationwide Children's Hospital. 

Outside of research, I enjoy [cycling](https://www.northstarcycling.org/), bowling with the Splits Will Tear Us Apart, [crafting](https://lettvi.github.io/files/chessboard.pdf), and browsing free craigslist postings for treasures I can DIY (or DIWHY) with.
