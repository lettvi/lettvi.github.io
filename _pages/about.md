I am a research scientist with the [Social Development Research Group](https://depts.washington.edu/sdrg/) in the School of Social Work, University of Washington. My research interests include occupational and substance use epidemiology and the effects that policies, programs, and where we live have on health outcomes. 

Emigrated from Hue, Vietnam, I was raised in Akron, Ohio (and hence, became [just another kid from Akron](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2016/06/lebron_james_im_just_a_kid_fro.html)). I received my PhD in Epidemiology at University of Washington, where my dissertation (advised by [Isaac Rhew](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/rhew-isaac/)) examined the relationship between cannabis use and access on prescription opioid use and other related outcomes among recently-injured workers in Washington. During my PhD training, I was a research assistant with the [Occupational Epidemiology and Health Outcomes Program](https://deohs.washington.edu/occepi/occupational-epidemiology-and-health-outcomes-program), under the direction of [Gary Franklin](https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/gary-m-franklin) and [Deborah Fulton-Kehoe](http://depts.washington.edu/hservphd/articles/1732). We collaborated with [WA State Labor & Industries](https://www.lni.wa.gov/) in order to evaluate policies, best practices, and health delivery models aimed at reducing work-related injuries and disability. 

I received my M.S in Epidemiology at The Ohio State University. My thesis, which examines the misuse of over-the-counter and prescription drug use among college students, was advised by [Abigail Norris Turner](https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/internal-medicine/abigail-norris-turner-phd). I also received my B.S. in Biology at tOSU, where minoring in [dubious](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1882751-the-craziest-tradition-in-college-football-is-osus-mirror-lake-jump) [traditions](https://bleacherreport.com/crossing-out-ms-traditionagainist) against the team from the north was common. 

Outside of research, I enjoy [cycling](https://www.northstarcycling.org/), swimming, bowling with the [Splits Will Tear Us Apart](https://www.bowlero.com/location/garage), [crafting](https://sustainablecapitolhill.org/tool-library/), and [woodworking](https://lettvi.github.io/files/chessboard.pdf).
