I am a PhD Candidate in Epidemiology at the University of Washington. My research interests include occupational and substance use epidemiology and the effects that policies, programs, and where we live have on health outcomes. 

Emigrated from Hue, Vietnam, I was raised in Akron, Ohio (and hence, became [just another kid from Akron](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2016/06/lebron_james_im_just_a_kid_fro.html)). I received my M.S in Epidemiology at The Ohio State University. My thesis, which examined the misuse of over-the-counter and prescription drug use among college students, was advised by [Abigail Norris Turner](https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/internal-medicine/abigail-norris-turner-phd). I also received my B.S. in Biology at tOSU, where minoring in [dubious](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1882751-the-craziest-tradition-in-college-football-is-osus-mirror-lake-jump) [traditions](https://bleacherreport.com/crossing-out-ms-traditionagainist) against the team from the north was common. 

Outside of research, I enjoy [cycling](https://www.northstarcycling.org/), swimming, bowling with the [Splits Will Tear Us Apart](https://www.bowlero.com/location/garage), [crafting]((https://sustainablecapitolhill.org/tool-library/) and [woodworking](https://lett.vi.github.io/_chessboard.pdf).

Things I am working on now
======
I am a research assistant at the [Occupational Epidemiology and Health Outcomes Program](https://deohs.washington.edu/occepi/occupational-epidemiology-and-health-outcomes-program), under the direction of [Gary Franklin](https://deohs.washington.edu/faculty/gary-m-franklin) and [Deborah Fulton-Kehoe](http://depts.washington.edu/hservphd/articles/1732). We collaborate with [WA State Labor & Industries](https://www.lni.wa.gov/) in order to evaluate policies, best practices, and health delivery models aimed at reducing work-related injuries and disability. One of our current projects involves the evaluation of telehealth policies and access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was recently accepted for publication in JOEM, but I have also worked on projects evaluating catastrophic care progams, opioid prescribing payment policies, and the usage of Master's level therapists. 

My dissertation is examining the relationship between cannabis use and access on prescription opioid use and other related outcomes among recently-injured workers in WA. Advised by [Isaac Rhew](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/rhew-isaac/), my aims are: 
1. To test whether the use of cannabis for pain management is associated with the time to discontinuation of prescription opioid use and on pain intensity and interference, psychological distress, and quality of life over 12 months from injury. 
2. To evaluate whether local availability and proximity to cannabis retail outlets is cross-sectionally associated with use of cannabis for pain management.
3. To examine whether changes in county-level retail availability are associated with changes in county-level occupational injury rates, after the opening of cannabis retailers.
