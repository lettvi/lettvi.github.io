Premise
======
* Adapted from one of the world's most popular pastimes, "what kind of asian are you?" is a game full of unexpected surprises (...I mean, does it ever get easier?). Players are subjected to assumptions (direct and indirect) about their ethnicity as they move through their day-to-day life. Watch as your card fill up, and you may get a BINGO (...and then proceed to spiral about what that really means). 

Footnotes
======
* While Asian Americans are often clumped together, there is substantial heterogenity and disparities among groups in the indicators for wellbeing (e.g., educational attainment, poverty, welfare receipt, and English language proficiency). (Makes sense...Asia is the largest continent on Earth, with each country having their own unique languages, cultures, and histories (+ degree of colonization)). 
* Caveat: the White experience shouldn't be the standard quo. Stated differently, maybe we should ask everybody where they came from, regardless of their race (e.g., how often are White folks asked about their origins? maybe they feel left out). More thoughts about this can be found here, here, and here. 
* It's a joke.
